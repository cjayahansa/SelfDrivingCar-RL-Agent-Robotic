# SelfDrivingCar-RL-Agent-Robotic

# 🤖 SelfDrivingCar-RL-Agent

A reinforcement learning (RL) based **self-driving car** project designed for robotics simulation environments.  
This project trains an autonomous driving agent using **Stable-Baselines3 (PPO)** on the **CarRacing-v3** environment from OpenAI Gym / Gymnasium.

The goal is to teach a robotic car to drive by itself — learning from trial and error, just like a human driver.
